-Balance
	-empty rooms are lame : ensure at least one interactive thing is in every room
	-countermeasure for stealing tiles : it should take a while (~5 sec) to pick up a tile if owned by somebody who is not you

-Bugs
	-volume sliders do not affect volume
	-menu is janky
		-most recent navigation input method (mouse, keyboard) should override others
	-weird bug where letter tile is placed on grid but stays in inventory and breaks shit
		-it has happened when placing a visual bomb on a team's grid in 2v2, but I can't get it to happen right now
	-sometimes grid square is highlighted but player can't interact with it. why?
	-dropped items should go back in their original transform, not always letter tile container
	-dash item gets broken by switching to diff inventory item during dash
	-if switch away from grappling hook while hook is out, cancel the grappling hook shot
	-bonking ejects player away from dropped letter tiles
		-probably because of high linear drag on letter tiles
	-flag doesnt change color when you pick it up from a non-claimable grid
	-pressing the select button does not select the first time it is pressed upon loading a scene
	-somehow some inventory stuff happened which disabled use of fireables on a fireable

-Balance
    -traveling takes too long late game : holding LT should start moving player at sprinting speed
    -countermeasure for stealing tiles : it should take a while (~5 sec) to pick up a tile if owned by somebody who is not you
    -tiles are a bit overabundant (reduce average lifespan?)
    -empty rooms are lame : ensure at least one interactive thing is in every room

        -Make them wider (little kid new to games had trouble getting through)
        -Display number of keys needed to open the door
-Bugs
    -menu is janky
        -mouse selection should move keyboard navigation to the selected item
        -mouse selection should happen on mouse move in addition to enter/exit
    -bonking ejects player away from dropped letter tiles
        -probably because of high linear drag on letter tiles
    -pressing the A button on a controller does not select the first time it is pressed upon loading a scene
    -recoloring squares while player is on top of them is slightly wrong
-Bugs I don't know how to trigger
    -weird bug where letter tile is placed on grid but stays in inventory and breaks shit
        -it has happened when placing a visual bomb on a team's grid in 2v2
    -somehow some inventory stuff happened which disabled use of fireables on a fireable

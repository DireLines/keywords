			-(including buttons)
	-sometimes grid square is highlighted but player can't interact with it. why?
	-Setting down items
		-items should go back in their original transform, not always letter tile container
	-dash item gets broken by switching to diff inventory item during dash
	-if switch away from grappling hook while hook is out, cancel the grappling hook shot
	-bonking ejects player away from dropped letter tiles
		-probably because of high linear drag on letter tiles
	-flag doesnt change color when you pick it up from a non-claimable grid
	-pressing the select button does not select the first time it is pressed upon loading a scene
	-somehow some inventory stuff happened which disabled use of fireables on a fireable
	-weird bug where letter tile is placed on grid but stays in inventory and breaks shit
		-it has happened when loading the game scene a second time, but that went away at some point
		-it has happened when placing a special letter tile on a neutral 4x4 grid
		-probably caused by interaction of team code and neutral grid code
